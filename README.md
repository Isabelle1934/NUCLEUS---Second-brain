NUCLEUS--Second-brain

Nucleus - Personal Dashboard & Knowledge Manager

Nucleus is a personal productivity dashboard and knowledge management web application designed to help users track tasks, monitor progress, visualize their mental growth, and organize their learning in a structured way. Inspired by tools like Obsidian, Nucleus combines interactive charts, a personal brain graph, a monthly calendar, and a dynamic task checklist into a single, elegant interface.

- **Progress Chart**: Visualize completed vs. pending tasks using a dynamic doughnut chart.
- **Mental Brain Visualization**: An interactive “brain” canvas that grows as you complete tasks, showing your achievements over time.
- **Monthly Calendar**: Keep track of activities on a calendar view, with compact and clear layout.
- **Development Graph**: An interactive network graph (inspired by Obsidian) showing positive and negative aspects of personal development, allowing users to explore patterns and relationships.
- **Dashboard Sidebar**: Navigate easily between different sections of the app.
